In digital logic and computing, a counter is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular event or process has occurred, often in relationship to a clock signal. In this experiment, different types of counters will be studied, both for the full binary sequence and for cycle lengths (N) different from powers of 2.
